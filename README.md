# Backend Development Demo (Jokes App)

This is a small application that I created to showcase some foundational backend development skills in the form of a program that stores and ouptuts jokes. It has the following features which I wrote from scratch, without using any backend frameworks or libraries:

  - A router
  - An API endpoint that takes a requested number and returns that many jokes
  - A nice frontend page which also takes a requested number and returns that many jokes, but outputs it in a user-friendly manner
  - A response class to output various commonly used responses
